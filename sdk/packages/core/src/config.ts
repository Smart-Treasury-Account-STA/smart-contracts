 * code (see docs/SECURITY_REVIEW_STRICT.md finding 29). The older
 * hand-deployed treasury from docs/TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT.md predates that fix
 * and is not the default here.
 *
 * `MAINNET` stays `undefined` until `buildMainnetConfig` is actually called
 * with real, deployed contract addresses -- no mainnet deployment exists
 * yet, and nothing here fabricates one. What *is* ready now is the rest of
 * the mainnet shape: the real, verified mainnet network passphrase
 * (`MAINNET_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`, a fixed protocol constant, unlike an RPC
 * URL) and `buildMainnetConfig` itself, so wiring in a real mainnet
 * deployment later is "call this function with the six addresses," not a
 * code change. Nothing else in this SDK assumes `testnet` specifically --
 * every helper takes a `NetworkConfig` as a parameter.
